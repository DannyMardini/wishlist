- Every click of a button that can possibly change a wishlist should be of type "wishlist_event". Every time a wishlist_event is fired it will fire off loads on all DOM elements that are subscribed to that event and load up a new wishlist. This can be done by adding the names of the divs to an array, then firing off that load on every element of that array.}
