                    Wishlist lets you keep track of all of your wishes in one location and shares your list with friends! <br />
                    Your friends can see when your birthday or anniversary is coming up and get you a present from your list without you knowing!<br /><br />
                    Our Goal is to make life easier by providing a central location where everyone can bookmark their wishes and their friends can easily see what they want!<br /><br />
