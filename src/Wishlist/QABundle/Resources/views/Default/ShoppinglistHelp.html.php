<div>Shopping lists are used to track the items that you plan to purchase. These items could consist of gifts
that you want to get for your family and friends or even a gift that you plan to buy for yourself.
The items will stay on your list until you remove them or until they are automatically popped off by Wishenda. 
Items are only popped off when the date that you promised to buy them by, has passed.</div>
